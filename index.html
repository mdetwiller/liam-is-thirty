              Maybe you’re right: let us stop explaining.<br>
              I know those ants too — soon<br>
              they’ll slurp caves into the handful of apples<br>
              that come on the pipsqueak tree out back,<br>
              or scurry dizzy on the sugar<br>
              glazing the sweetest bean I’ve ever tasted,<br>
              the beans themselves tonguing<br>
              through the spent cherry bush.<br><br>

It's far more delicious and complex than almond extract. I love it with any stoned fruit whether cooked with the fruit itself or flavouring a cream or custard alongside it.

                        <u>Seed collection</u>: Black cherry fruit is a fleshy drupe containing a single seed. Harvest the fruit in the late summer after they change from reddish-brown to black. The fruit covering can be rubbed off under running water.<br><br>
                        Large amounts of seed can be separated from the fruit using a modified blender method. They can be stored dry for long periods in air tight containers in the refrigerator.<br><br>
                        <u>Seed dormancy</u>: Black cherry has physiological dormancy. <br><br>
                        <u>Seed germination</u>: Stratify seeds using moist chilling for 120 days to satisfy physiological dormancy. Following stratification, sow seeds in a nursery container to produce a seedling or sow them in a plastic container in the classroom to observe germination.
